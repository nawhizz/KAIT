----------------------
The "JVCL Convert" will compile ONLY under Delphi 6
---------------------

The "JVCL Convert" is a program to Search/Replace any strings in a given text file. You can create your own sets of strings that you can apply later on repeatedly to your files.

JVCL provides you with a "RxLib.dat" file that can be used to convert to JVCL any Delphi files *.pas, *.dpr, *.dpk) utilizing RxLib components/files. In the future we will provide files for conversion of files based on RALib and Jans  components.

In order to use "JVCL Convert" as a RxLib conversion tool, please follow the steps below:

- open "JVCL Convert"

- select files to convert: you can do it in three different ways:

a) drag & drop from a Windows Explorer
b) select a subdirectory and scan all Delphi files (*.pas, *.dpr, *.dpk) in it and its subdirectories
c) Open and select individual files

- once the files are selected, you can remove some of them, if needed

- open the "RxLib.dat" file. It contains all the RxLib related strings that need to be replaced

- click on the convert icon.

If you want to check the process first before making any real changes to your files, you can use the simulation mode (see Options)

We have also provided a "Delphi2CompilerDefs.dat" file, that you can use to convert DelphiXXX define settings to CompilerXXX settings.

IMPORTANT:
=============
Please note: for best results, you should leave all the Options as they are, i.e. checked, especially the "Whole words only"
